The goal of this project is to answer the following questions about the Airbnb data:
1. What are the most expensive and least expensive time to travel to Seattle and Boston?
2. What are the top 5 most expesive neighbourhoods to rent Airbnb's for each city? How does this differ from the top 5 least expensive neighbourhoods?
3. What property types are the most and least expensive to rent for each city? 
4. How well can you predict the price based off of the city, year, month, neighbourhood, and price?
